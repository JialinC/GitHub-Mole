"""
This module defines the UserGistComments class, which constructs and executes a paginated GraphQL query
to retrieve comments on a user's gists from GitHub. It includes methods to extract and process the 
retrieved data, such as counting comments created before a specific time.

Classes:
    UserGistComments: Handles the construction and execution of the paginated GraphQL query for user gist comments.

Functions:
    user_gist_comments(raw_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        Extracts and returns the gist comments from the raw query data.

    created_before_time(gist_comments: List[Dict[str, Any]], time: str) -> int:
        Counts how many gist comments were created before a specific time.
